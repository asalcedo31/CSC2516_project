\section{Introduction}

Modern neural networks tend to be immensely large with several millions of connections and weights. The memory and energy requirements for deploying such networks is significant, and constantly growing with the complexity of state-of-the-art networks. Although having a large number of trainable parameters is beneficial to network accuracy, it was shown by \citet{NIPS_learning_weights_pruning}, \citet{OBD} and \citet{OBS} that the impact of some parameters is negligible in comparison with others. Successful identification and removal (``pruning'') of such parameters would lead to smaller and faster networks, which in turn would significantly reduce the computational cost at test time. The goal of most pruning algorithms is to achieve computational advantages without an appreciable impact on accuracy. The importance and relevance of network pruning was recently highlighted via MorphNet, proposed by \citet{morphnet} at Google to optimize existing networks through pruning.

It was argued by \citet{prune_transfer_learning} that pruning can also be applied in the context of transfer learning, for generalization of a trained network to related datasets. Improved ability of networks to generalize as a result of pruning was also achieved by \citet{prune_for_architecture}. However, these approaches target networks that have been trained on a single dataset. In contrast, the concept of learning the hyperparameters of a network by using multiple datasets, known as ``meta-learning", has also been proposed by \citet{metalearning1}. To the best of our knowledge, the meta-learning concept has not been applied in the context of network pruning.

The above points motivate the main idea proposed in this work: designing pruning methodologies that specifically target improved generalization of a given network, by leveraging multiple datasets during training. The goal is to optimize existing networks not only to be faster and smaller, but also to improve their ability to generalize. We first implement and study some simple and commonly-used pruning strategies and analyze their impact on network size, speed and accuracy. We then discuss and implement a simple meta-learning algorithm and study its performance. Finally, we combine the pruning strategies with the meta-learning algorithm to introduce a proof-of-concept ``meta-pruning'' methodology.


\section{A Study on Simple Pruning Algorithms}

\subsection{Masking Classifier Layers}

\subsection{Masking Convolution Filters}

\subsection{Pruning Convolution Filters}

One method to prune convolutional layers is to reduce the number of output channels in each layer, which involves reducing the size of associated weight matrices. This impacts not only the convolution layer being pruned, but also the number of input channels in the next layer of the network. This approach was proposed by \cite{prune_transfer_learning}, and has since been implemented via open-source code provided by \cite{jacobgilblog}. However, this implementation only allows for pruning a single output channel at a time. We have implemented a version of this technique that allows pruning out several filters simultaneously, greatly improving the efficiency of aforementioned the code.

Although a relatively sophisticated strategy for picking pruned channels was presented by \cite{prune_transfer_learning}, in our implementation we use two simple metrics to decide which channels are to be pruned: the 2-norm of the layer's activations, and the 2-norm of weights. In each case, pruning occurs after every $N_i$ epochs, until training is complete. The number of output channels to prune, $N_p$, is set via the hyperparameter $p$, which is a percentage of the total available parameters in that network, $N_\mathrm{total}$:
\begin{align}
	N_p = \mathrm{round} \left(\dfrac{p}{100}N_\mathrm{total}\right). \label{eqNp}
\end{align}
In the activation-based approach, the activations of each layer are accumulated over the $N_i$ epochs preceding a single pruning pass via the function \texttt{TrackConv2DNorms}. This is done as follows: at each training iteration, we compute the 2-norm of the activations of each layer, across all of the input data dimensions (function \texttt{ComputeConv2DActNorms}). The output of this is a vector whose size is the number of output channels of a particular layer, and one such vector is constructed for each convolution layer. These vectors represent the strength of the activations of each filter. Optionally, these vectors can be normalized to their maximum values to ensure that every set of $N_i$ epochs is equally represented.

The new activation norm vectors computed at each iteration are added to the previously stored vectors. Every $N_i$ epochs, we look at the accumulated activation vector and extract the indices corresponding to the $N_p$ smallest activations (function \texttt{PruneAllConv2DLayers}). This tells us the $N_p$ filters of each layer which had, on average, the weakest activations over the last $N_i$ epochs. Those filters are then pruned away, and the old model is replaced with the updated, smaller model (function \texttt{PruneConvLayers}). At this stage, the accumulated activation norm vectors are reset to their initial state, ready to start accumulating activations for the next $N_i$ epochs.

When pruning based on weights, the strategy is the same as above, except that rather than accumulating activations, we accumulate the 2-norms of the weight matrices themselves. The 2-norms are computed over the input channel dimension, and over the kernel of each filter (function \texttt{ComputeConv2DWeightNorms}). Again, this yields, for each layer, a vector containing 2-norms corresponding to the weights of each output channel. This can also be optionally normalized to the maximum value in each vector. Every $N_i$ epochs, these accumulated vectors are used to prune away the weakest $N_p$ filters.

The methodology described above is summarized in \algoref{FilterPruneBasic}.
The results of both methods in comparison to the baseline (no pruning) are discussed below.

**************** Text below is copied from proposal ****************

A variety of pruning algorithms have been proposed, many of which apply to convolutional neural networks. Some remove individual weights (leading to sparse weight matrices) while others remove entire filters, channels or layers. Units may be removed based on many criteria, including their magnitude, their contribution to the final loss (approximated through their gradients), and information criteria such as entropy~\citet{NIPS_learning_weights_pruning, prune_transfer_learning, prune_entropy, prune_slimming}.  Pruning may be applied towards a human-defined architecture (e.g. removing a certain proportion of weights in each layer)~\citet{prune_nisp} or help determine the final architecture autonomously~\citet{prune_thinet}. 

\section{Goals}





After each dataset sample, only connections that survive pruning and thus contribute to the final loss will be retained.  At the beginning of each dataset sample, weights will be initialized with the value of the updated weights in the previous sample. We hypothesize that this approach will result in weights that are important for a broad set of related tasks. 

It has been suggested~\citet{prune_for_architecture} that pruning can also improve algorithm efficiency by virtue of the resulting architecture, rather than just the resulting weights. Therefore, we will also assess a modified meta-pruning algorithm that only retains the architecture, and not the weights, across datasets:



We hypothesize that this approach will result in architectures that are more generalizable and efficient than the full model. Comparing the two approaches in algorithms 1 and 2 will illuminate the relative contributions of the weights and the architecture to the value of pruning for generalizability. 

\section{Methods}

We will first select a relatively simple pruning algorithm that can be adapted to the meta-pruning approach described above, as a proof of concept. Since pruning studies to date have largely focused on convolutional neural networks, we will develop our algorithm in the context of image recognition, initially working with the CIFAR-100 data. For the initial model, we will use VGGNet due to its simple architecture and expand to ResNet if time allows. To assess our algorithms' baseline performance, we will use test images which have the same categories as the training images. We will then assess our algorithms' capacity to generalize using a test set that contains a distinct set of categories from the training set. We will use cross entropy loss and assess the algorithms' performance by comparing its classification accuracy to the accuracy of the full model, as well as a reduced model with the same number of connections but where connections are randomly dropped. We will also compare the training time, memory requirements, and the number of retained parameters to assess the algorithms' efficiency and quantify the amount of compression achieved.

An important consideration in the proposed algorithms is the consequence of pruning to backpropagation. Particularly in algorithm 1, depending on the order in which operations are applied, special care must be taken to ensure that gradients are computed correctly for the pruned model, at each outer iteration. One way to circumvent the issue is to recompute gradients every time the model is updated via pruning. However, it may be possible to do this more intelligently by applying advanced techniques for gradients of discrete problems. This will be an area to explore, if time permits.

\section{Nice-to-haves}

There are several additional analyses we can incorporate if time allows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To ensure our results are not specific to a particular pruning method, we can test meta-pruning using several pruning algorithms that span a range of approaches.
	\item Explore how to modify the meta-pruning approach to preserve connections that are retained in most, but not all training sets.
	\item Leverage the meta-learning framework to learn how to prune~\citet{NIPS_learning_weights_pruning}.
	\item Explicitly incorporate transfer learning into the meta-learning framework by assessing loss on a pseudo-test validation set with different categories~\citet{metalearning2}.
	\item Apply meta-pruning to a more complex real-world dataset in a transfer learning context.

%\label{headings}
%
%All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
%flush left, and bold.
%
%First-level headings should be in 12-point type.
%
%\subsection{Headings: second level}
%
%Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.
%
%\subsubsection{Headings: third level}
%
%Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.
%
%\paragraph{Paragraphs}
%
%There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
%bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
%of space.
%
%\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
%\label{others}
%
%These instructions apply to everyone.
%
%\subsection{Citations within the text}
%
%The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
%author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
%format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
%used consistently.
%
%The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
%\begin{center}
%  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
%\end{center}
%Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
%use in inline text.  For example,
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
%\end{verbatim}
%produces
%\begin{quote}
%  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
%\end{quote}
%
%If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
%following before loading the \verb+neurips_2018+ package:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
%argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2018}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
%person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
%previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
%(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
%citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''
%
%\subsection{Footnotes}
%
%Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
%footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
%text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
%Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).
%
%Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
%marks.\footnote{As in this example.}
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%
%\begin{figure}
%  \centering
%  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
%\end{figure}
%
%All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
%purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
%figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
%the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
%proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.
%
%You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
%paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
%color.
%
%\subsection{Tables}
%
%All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
%title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.
%
%Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
%table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
%be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
%numbered consecutively.
%
%Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
%strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
%typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
%\begin{center}
%  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
%\end{center}
%This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.
%
%\begin{table}
%  \caption{Sample table title}
%  \label{sample-table}
%  \centering
%  \begin{tabular}{lll}
%    \toprule
%    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%    \midrule
%    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%    \bottomrule
%  \end{tabular}
%\end{table}
%
%\section{Final instructions}
%
%Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
%particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
%fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
%\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
%numbered.
%
%\section{Preparing PDF files}
%
%Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
%example, ``A4.''
%
%Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
%contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
%achieve this.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.
%
%\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.
%
%\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
%  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
%  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}
%
%\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%  "solid" shapes instead.
%
%\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage{amsfonts}
%\end{verbatim}
%followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
%for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
%workaround for reals, natural and complex:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
%\end{verbatim}
%Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
%you to fix it.
%
%\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}
%
%Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
%\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
%\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
%figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
%\end{verbatim}
%See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
%(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})
%
%A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
%line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
%necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
go at the end of the paper. Do not include acknowledgments in the anonymized
submission, only in the final paper.

\bibliographystyle{apalike} % IEEEtran is only available via some tex installations. Can change to any other, e.g. "plain".
\bibliography{references}

%\section*{References}
%
%References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
%the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
%consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
%when listing the references. {\bf Remember that you can use more than eight
%  pages as long as the additional pages contain \emph{only} cited references.}
